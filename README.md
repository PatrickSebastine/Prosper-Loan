# Exploratory Data Analysis: Prosper Loan
## by Patrick Ugheoke Sebastine

## Introduction
>  This notebook will document my attempt to study a fascinating dataset from the Prosper loan. Despite the numerous questions that can be raised regarding the data, my focus will be solely on the exploratory data analysis (EDA).

>The dataset provided contains information on loan listings from the Prosper lending platform. The information provided in the dataset includes various details on the loans such as the loan amount, interest rate, credit rating, loan status, and various demographic details of the borrowers such as their employment status, occupation, state, and credit score. Some of the variables are only relevant for loans originated after July 2009 and may not be applicable for all loans in the dataset. This dataset can be used for exploratory analysis to understand the **loan characteristics and the factors affecting loan performance**.

>  The primary source of data for this project is the "Python Project 5.xlsx" file. The file consists of two worksheets: "prosperLoanData" which holds the dataset and "Variable description" that provides information on the data columns.  
>  The "prosperLoanData" worksheet has been saved as a CSV file named "Prosper Loan.csv" and will be used for the EDA.

## My tasks include the following steps:

> - Download the 'Python Project 5' xlsx file from the class files page. It contains two sheets: the dataset for the project and a description of the variables in the dataset.
> -  Get the 'Prosper Loan' csv file from the class files page. The csv format of the project dataset.
> -  Download the Jupyter Notebook template to use for your project.
> -  Read in your csv file, assess and clean your dataframe and create visualizations following the notebook template.
> -  Endeavor to follow the tips, suggestions and overall format of the template. 
> -  Convert your notebook to a PDF or HTML file for submission.

## Conclusions
> Based on the visualizations, it can be concluded that Prosper Loans have borrowers with a majority of "4" ratings in the Prosper Rating Numeric and Prosper Score, and a "C" rating in the Prosper Rating Alpha, with most borrowers taking out a 36-month loan term. Most of the borrowers listed the loan catgory as debt consolidation, while homeownership is more likely for borrowers with higher ratings and those who took out a 60-month loan. Also, employed borrowers are more likely to be homeowners than unemployed or part-time employment. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between borrower's annual percentage rate (APR) and the interest rate and lender's yield, while there is a negative correlation between the loan amount and APR, and prosper score and APR, which can provide valuable insights to help lenders make informed decisions and manage loan portfolios effectively.
